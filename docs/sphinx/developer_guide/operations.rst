Operations
==========

Operational runbook for running, rebuilding, and verifying the RePORT AI Portal
pipeline. Deployment controls and release gates live in
:doc:`production_readiness`.

Prerequisites
-------------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Requirement
     - Check
   * - Python 3.11+
     - ``python --version``
   * - uv package manager
     - ``uv --version``
   * - Dependencies synced
     - ``uv sync --all-groups``
   * - LLM provider configured
     - ``echo $LLM_PROVIDER`` (or set in ``config/config.yaml``)
   * - Study data in place
     - ``data/raw/{STUDY}/`` with ``datasets/``, ``annotated_pdfs/``,
       ``data_dictionary/``

Pipeline Run
------------

Full Pipeline (Recommended)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

   make pipeline

Runs all steps in order: dictionary → dataset extraction → AMBER scrub
(eight-action catalog, rule + allowlist) → atomic publish into the
``llm_source/`` GREEN zone → variables-reference build. PDFs are
processed in a separate leg (``make pdf-extract``); they are gated
behind ``REPORTALIN_PDF_PHI_FREE=1`` because annotated CRFs are
PHI-bearing by default.

Individual Steps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Command
     - What it does
   * - ``make dictionary``
     - Load data dictionary
   * - ``make pdf-extract``
     - PDF extraction to JSONL (gated by ``REPORTALIN_PDF_PHI_FREE``;
       see :doc:`data_extraction_pdfs`)
   * - ``make extract-datasets``
     - Dataset extraction into AMBER staging, run through the eight-action
       PHI scrub, then atomically promoted into the GREEN ``llm_source/``
   * - ``make bundle``
     - Re-assemble the llm_source bundle from already-scrubbed staging artifacts
   * - ``make chat``
     - Launch the Streamlit research-assistant UI (with setup wizard)
   * - ``make chat-cli``
     - Launch the CLI research-assistant (interactive REPL)

Serve
~~~~~

.. note::

   The AI Assistant chat interface is available via ``make chat-cli``
   (interactive CLI REPL) or ``make chat`` (Streamlit web UI). See
   AI Assistant below.

.. code-block:: bash

   make chat-cli   # CLI Research Assistant (interactive REPL)
   make chat       # Streamlit Research Assistant UI (with setup wizard)

Quickstart
~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

   make quickstart  # sync → pipeline

Artifact Rebuild
----------------

When schemas, the data dictionary, or the eight-action PHI scrub catalog
(``scripts/security/phi_scrub.yaml``) change:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Full rebuild
   make nuke && make quickstart

Cleanup
-------

.. code-block:: bash

   make clean       # Caches, sessions, stale logs (safe)
   make nuke        # Full reset: venv, output, indexes (confirmation required)

**Retention rules:**

- ``tests/fixtures/`` — never touched by cleanup
- ``data/raw/`` — manual cleanup only (source of truth)

Security Verification
---------------------

Dataset Promotion Protocol
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After ``make pipeline`` produces clean JSONL:

1. Manually inspect ``output/{STUDY}/llm_source/`` for any unexpected
   residual content
2. Spot-check dataset records:
   ``head -20 output/{STUDY}/llm_source/dataset_schema/files/*.jsonl``
3. Step 1.6 of the pipeline scrubs staged datasets in place via the
   8-action honest-broker catalog (:mod:`scripts.security.phi_scrub`).
   If residual content is found in llm_source/, inspect
   ``output/{STUDY}/audit/phi_scrub_report.json`` for the action counts,
   add the offending field pattern to ``scripts/security/phi_scrub.yaml``
   under the appropriate section (``drop_fields``, ``cap_fields``, etc.),
   and re-run ``make pipeline``.
4. Cross-check ``output/{STUDY}/audit/lineage_manifest.json`` — every
   raw input SHA-256 should have a corresponding trio artifact entry.

Zone Enforcement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Verify zone guards are active:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run pytest tests/security/test_zone_guard.py -v

Quality Checks
--------------

.. code-block:: bash

   make test          # deterministic pytest subset
   make test-all      # full pytest suite
   make lint          # ruff
   make typecheck     # mypy
   make ci            # All quality checks
   make doc-freshness # Catch stale prose (vector-DB / "only zone" / wrong tool count / …)
   make docs          # Build sphinx HTML
   uv run pip-audit   # Dependency security audit

Debug and Troubleshooting
-------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

   make debug       # Pipeline + serve with DEBUG logging

Common issues:

- **No LLM configured:** Set ``LLM_PROVIDER`` env var or ``config/config.yaml``
- **Missing study data:** Ensure ``data/raw/{STUDY}/`` has the required
  subdirectories
- **Dependency issues:** ``uv lock --upgrade && uv sync --all-groups``
- **Stale artifacts:** ``make nuke && make quickstart``

Known Limitations
-----------------

- Single-study mode only — one study directory under ``data/raw/``
- LLM provider must be explicitly configured (no default)


AI Assistant
------------

The AI Assistant research assistant uses LangGraph with a ReAct agent
pattern. It reads from the llm_source bundle and provides study-specific
answers grounded in the data dictionary, PDF extractions, and dataset
metadata. Retrieval is deliberately local and tool-based: variable search
combines ``variables.json`` with published dataset schemas; CRF/PDF context
search uses normalized keyword, abbreviation, and source-metadata scoring;
record-level questions go through deterministic dataset or analysis tools.
Do not document or promise 100% answer accuracy. Improve accuracy by
adding reviewed source artifacts, strengthening retrieval tests, and
measuring representative question/answer sets for correctness, grounding,
and retrieval relevance.

.. code-block:: bash

    make chat-cli   # CLI interactive REPL (or `python main.py --chat` directly)
    make chat       # Streamlit web UI (or `python main.py --web` directly)
