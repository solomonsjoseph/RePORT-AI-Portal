"""Per-run lineage manifest for the RePORT AI Portal pipeline.

Regulators auditing a clinical de-identification pipeline want a single
artifact that ties every input file to every output file with hashes and
timestamps at each transformation step. This module produces that
artifact as ``output/{STUDY}/audit/lineage_manifest.json``.

The manifest records:

* **Run metadata** — pipeline version, extraction engine, UTC timestamp,
  compliance posture, study name.
* **Inputs** — every raw file that entered the pipeline this run, with
  SHA-256 + size + mtime.
* **Outputs** — every file in the published ``llm_source/`` + every
  audit report, with SHA-256 + size.
* **Steps** — per-leg (datasets / dictionary / pdfs) timestamps and
  rule-action counts (read from existing audit reports; this module
  does NOT re-compute scrub events).

The manifest carries only counts and hashes — never raw PHI values.
Caller must ensure :func:`emit_lineage_manifest` runs AFTER
``_publish_staging`` so the llm_source bundle exists and AFTER all audit
reports are on disk.

IRB-grade benchmark anchors:
    * NIST SP 800-188 §7 governance + audit
    * FDA 21 CFR Part 11 §11.10(e) audit record requirements
    * ICMR 2017 §11.5 audit + confidentiality
    * CDISC ODM origin/source traceability
