"""PHI-redacting log filter for the RePORT AI Portal host publish path.

Before the PHI scrub runs (Step 1.6), the trusted host publish path processes
raw subject data — raw SUBJIDs, raw dates, raw narrative strings. If any of
that content is logged at INFO / DEBUG during extraction or orchestration, it
lands in ``.logs/*.log`` and becomes a PHI side-channel the scrub does not
touch.

This module installs a ``logging.Filter`` that redacts likely-PHI
substrings from every log record before the handler emits. Specifically:

* **Subject IDs** — any literal substring matching the configured
  ``subject_id_fields`` regex catalogue is replaced with a stable HMAC
  tag ``<SUBJ_{HMAC[:8]}>``. Same-subject redaction is deterministic
  across a run (the HMAC key is loaded once at filter install time).
* **Common PHI regex classes** — Aadhaar, PAN, Indian phone, email,
  SSN, ISO/M-D-Y dates, Indian PIN-code patterns are replaced with a
  category tag like ``<AADHAAR>`` or ``<EMAIL>``.

Design constraints:

* **No raw values in filter memory** — the filter stores only compiled
  regex + the PHI HMAC key; never a raw value.
* **Fast path for clean messages** — the filter short-circuits if the
  message contains none of the pre-compiled triggers, so the common
  case pays one substring search per record.
* **Fail-closed per record** — on any exception during redaction, the filter
  replaces the message with a fixed redaction-failure notice. Logs remain
  useful for operations without passing raw PHI through.

IRB-grade benchmark anchors:
    * ICMR 2017 §11.5 audit + confidentiality
    * HIPAA §164.312(b) audit controls
    * NIST SP 800-188 §6.4 on side-channel closure
