"""Hardened AMBER-zone staging helpers for the RePORT AI Portal pipeline.

The pipeline processes raw study data (PHI) in a transient staging workspace
under ``tmp/{STUDY_NAME}/`` before atomically publishing the PHI-free
``llm_source/``. Staging is the honest-broker AMBER zone — it must carry
the strongest defensive posture the local filesystem supports:

* **Restrictive permissions** — directory mode ``0700`` + umask ``0077``
  for every write, so no other OS user can read partial staging output.
* **Secure teardown** — on successful completion, each staging file is
  **overwritten with random bytes and fsynced before unlink**, reducing
  the window where deleted staging contents could be recovered via
  filesystem forensics.
* **In-memory staging (optional)** — when the environment sets
  ``REPORTALIN_TMPFS_STAGING=1`` AND ``/dev/shm`` is writable, staging is
  redirected to a tmpfs mount so raw extracted data never touches the
  physical disk on the extraction host. Otherwise falls back to the
  default on-disk staging root resolved by :mod:`config`.

The module is pure filesystem plumbing: it never reads row contents,
never logs values, never crosses zone boundaries. Every file operation
is wrapped by :func:`scripts.security.secure_env.assert_write_zone` so a
misconfigured staging root fails fast with a zone violation rather than
silently writing outside the allowed area.

IRB-grade benchmark anchors (see docs/sphinx/irb_auditor/):
    * HIPAA §164.310(c) device + media controls
    * NIST SP 800-188 §6.3-§6.5 on transient de-identification workspaces
    * ICMR 2017 §11.5 audit + confidentiality
    * DPDPA 2023 §8(7) erasure

Public API:
    * :func:`resolve_staging_root` — where should staging live this run?
    * :func:`prepare_staging` — wipe + create with hardened permissions
    * :func:`secure_remove_tree` — zero-fill + unlink every file below path
    * :func:`scoped_umask` — context manager for umask 0077 during a block
