"""Canonical per-study pipeline lock (Wave 4 B3.7 / D1 extraction).

This module is the single source of truth for the exclusive, per-study process
lock that gates the host publish path. It was extracted verbatim from
``main.py`` so the new orchestrator skill (``report-ai-study-pipeline/run.py``)
and ``main.py`` share *one* lock implementation rather than racing two copies on
the same ``fcntl`` flock.

**Lock-baton handoff.** The orchestrator (or the legacy
``extract_to_llm_source`` wrapper) acquires the study flock *before* spawning
``main.py --pipeline`` as a subprocess. Re-acquiring the same lock file from the
child would deadlock (POSIX: same path, different fd), so the child honours a
baton passed via two env vars:

* ``REPORTAL_PIPELINE_LOCK_HELD_BY_PARENT == "1"`` — the parent claims the lock,
* ``REPORTAL_PIPELINE_LOCK_PARENT_PID`` — the parent's PID, which must name a
  live process equal to ``os.getppid()`` (GAP-3 validation).

A leaked/stale baton inherited by an unrelated direct ``python main.py`` run
fails validation and falls through to a real acquisition, so a forged env var
can never silently disable the lock.

The module owns the lock handle as a process-level singleton; query it with
:func:`is_locally_held` rather than reaching for the handle directly.
