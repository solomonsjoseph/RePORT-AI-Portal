"""Canonical utilities package for RePORT AI Portal.

**What.** Shared infrastructure that the pipeline legs, the PHI surface, the
agent, and the test suite all rely on: centralised logging
(:mod:`.logging_system`), structured error envelopes (:mod:`.errors`),
hardened AMBER-zone staging (:mod:`.secure_staging`), per-run lineage
manifest emission (:mod:`.lineage`), PHI log redaction (:mod:`.log_hygiene`), and
streamed-SHA-256 integrity helpers (:mod:`.integrity`).

**Why.** Downstream code should not need to know which submodule lives where
for the common entry points — a single ``from scripts.utils import …`` is
the idiomatic import path. Keeping this module's ``__all__`` tight also
surfaces which symbols belong to the stable runtime contract vs. which
are internal implementation detail.

**How.** Each submodule is independently importable for its full surface
(including private helpers used by tests). This ``__init__`` only re-exports
the symbols that downstream callers should reach for; new submodules can
grow here without upsetting existing call sites.
