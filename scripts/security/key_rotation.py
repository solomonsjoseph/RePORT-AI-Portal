"""PHI HMAC key-rotation detection (Wave 3 C1.3).

Rotating the HMAC key changes every pseudonym :func:`scripts.security.phi_scrub.pseudo_id`
produces, so subjects published under the old key no longer link to subjects
published under the new one. That is a legitimate but consequential operator
action (it requires full re-ingestion to restore cross-run linkage), and it must
never happen *silently*. This module records the key fingerprint a study was last
published with and compares it on the next run.

Design notes
------------
* **Pure core.** :func:`detect_rotation` is a side-effect-free comparison so the
  decision logic is trivially unit-testable; :func:`check_and_record` is the
  stateful wrapper that reads the prior record, classifies, and persists the new
  one.
* **First run is never a rotation** (plan risk #4). When no prior fingerprint is
  recorded — every pre-C1 study, and every brand-new study — the result is
  :data:`RotationStatus.FIRST_RUN`, not ``ROTATED``. Otherwise the very first
  run after this feature shipped would false-alarm on every existing study.
* **Value-free.** The state file holds only the SHA-256 fingerprint (already a
  one-way hash of the key, never the key itself) plus run-id provenance. It lives
  in the audit zone (no-LLM) like other IRB evidence.
