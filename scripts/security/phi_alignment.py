"""AI-assisted PHI header→rule alignment (Note 9 + Note 8 "specify method").

For a column header that NO deterministic pinned rule covers, the AI infers the
variable's nature from its NAME (e.g. ``b_dat`` / ``birdat`` / ``birthDate`` →
birth date), looks up the applicable rule in the value-free rulebook, and ALIGNS
the column to that rule's ACTION while emitting a regex that recognizes the
column. The rulebook (from official guidance) defines the POLICY; the AI only
decides *which* rule a fuzzy-named column maps to and writes the pattern.

Safety (separation of powers):

* **GR-1** — the AI receives ONLY the column NAME + the value-free rulebook JSON.
  Never a dataset row value.
* **AI proposes, determinism disposes** — every proposal is verified by
  :func:`verify_aligned_rule` (action ∈ the existing set; regex compiles, matches
  its own header, is not over-broad; the action agrees with the cited rulebook
  rule; the citation is an official source). Up to ``max_attempts`` tries; on
  failure the header goes to human review (value-free) — it is never silently
  kept.
* **Pinned rules stay the floor** — alignment only runs for the *uncovered* set,
  and a bad proposal can only be rejected, never lower protection.

The verified rules are frozen into the scrub config + captured in the snapshot
(reproducibility); the deterministic ``run_scrub`` engine applies them.
