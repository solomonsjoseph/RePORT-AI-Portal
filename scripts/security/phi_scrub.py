"""PHI scrubber — structural-field honest-broker catalog for RePORT AI Portal.

Nine structural-field action classes, evaluated in strict priority order
(first match wins per field):

1. **keep** (``keep_fields``) — allowlist; short-circuits every other rule.
   Used to protect clinical lab / medication / time-of-day / categorical
   indicators from being swept up by broader patterns.
2. **birthdate** (``birthdate_field``) — posture-dependent:

   - ``safe_harbor`` (default) → field dropped entirely per HIPAA
     §164.514(b)(2)(i)(C) + DPDPA. Age fidelity is lost.
   - ``limited_dataset`` → field jittered with the same per-subject offset
     as other dates (SANT method), preserving age-at-event. Requires an
     IRB-approved protocol + DUA; the module refuses to run in this
     mode unless ``authorities/phi_limited_dataset.md`` exists.

3. **drop** (``drop_fields``) — field removed from every row. Covers
   names, initials, signatures, staff identifiers, national IDs (Aadhaar /
   PAN / voter / passport / DL / ration / ESIC / PM-JAY / Nikshay / ABHA),
   contact info, exact geography, free-text narratives, system timestamps,
   and batch/scan artefacts.
4. **cap** (``cap_fields``) — numeric values strictly greater than
   ``threshold`` are replaced with ``label`` (default age > 89 → "90+",
   HIPAA §164.514(b)(2)(i)(C)).
5. **generalize** (``generalize_fields`` + ``generalization_maps``) —
   value-level categorical mapping (e.g. marital status → Married / Single
   / Other; facility type → Government / Private / Other).
6. **band** (``band_fields``) — numeric or categorical values mapped to
   broad ranges or categories (e.g. age groups, income bands). Configured
   via ``band_ranges`` (numeric) and ``band_maps`` (categorical) in
   ``phi_scrub.yaml``. Fail-closed: an unmapped value quarantines the row.
7. **suppress_small_cell** (``suppress_small_cell_fields``) — numeric
   values strictly greater than ``small_cell_threshold`` are clamped to the
   threshold (ICMR §11.7 k-anonymity proxy for household-contact counts).
8. **date** (``date_fields``) — per-subject deterministic offset in
   ``[-max_jitter_days, +max_jitter_days]``. Offset = ``HMAC-SHA256(key,
   subject_id)[:4] as int mod (2*N+1) - N``. SANT-method interval
   preservation for epidemiological survival / incidence / person-time
   analyses.
9. **id** (``id_fields``) — replaced with
   ``"RID_" + label + "_" + alpha12(hmac_sha256(key, label + ":" + raw_id))``.
   Deterministic cross-file linkage preserved; non-reversible without key
   possession. The ``RID_`` envelope plus alphabet-only tag keeps generated
   pseudonyms from matching raw subject-ID, phone, or date regexes in the
   pre-publication leak gate.

Free-text PHI residuals are handled conservatively by dropping narrative
fields wholesale. Current narrative fields like ``*COMMENT``, ``*REMARK``,
``WITHDRAWEXPLAIN``, and ``*SPECIFY`` are removed before publication; the
agent-boundary PHI gate remains defense-in-depth for returned text.

Rule catalog is declared in ``phi_scrub.yaml`` (Indo-VAP-calibrated).

Zone boundary
-------------
* Reads + rewrites ``tmp/{STUDY}/datasets/*.jsonl`` in place (write_zone).
* Optionally writes orphan rows to ``tmp/{STUDY}/quarantine/{file}.jsonl``
  when a row lacks a resolvable subject_id (write_zone).
* Emits a single audit envelope at :data:`config.AUDIT_SCRUB_REPORT_PATH`
  (output_zone). The audit records **counts only** — no raw values, no
  before/after pairs.

Ordering in the host publish path
---------------------------------
Runs as Step 1.6 — AFTER Step 1+3 (raw extraction) and BEFORE Step 1.7
(dataset cleanup). This keeps ``dataset_cleanup_report.json`` free of raw
subject IDs and raw dates, so the dataset-leg audit never contains PHI.

Key management
--------------
The HMAC key is a sidecar file at
``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/report_ai_portal/phi_key`` (default ``~/.config/report_ai_portal/phi_key``).
Mode must be ``0600``. Missing key = hard-fail for developer/operator host
publish runs. Normal users create it through the web UI's Load Study flow.
Developers can bootstrap explicitly::

    python -m scripts.security.phi_scrub bootstrap-key

Rotating the key invalidates every previously-scrubbed artifact — full
re-ingestion from raw is required. This is a one-way property: deletion of
the key forfeits the ability to re-derive the same pseudonyms.

Idempotency
-----------
Each scrubbed record gets a ``_phi_scrubbed: "v3"`` marker. A second run
with the same key is a no-op (the sentinel file
``tmp/{STUDY}/.phi_scrub_complete`` short-circuits the orchestrator).

Threat-model summary
--------------------
* HMAC-SHA256 with a secret key is non-reversible without key possession.
* 12 alphabet (a-p) chars (48 bits) collision surface is adequate for single-study cohorts
  under 100 000 subjects. Larger cohorts should widen the slice.
* Same (key, subject_id) always yields the same pseudonym → cross-run
  joins remain stable across re-ingestion.
* Different machines with different keys → different pseudonyms → hard
  cross-site joins. This is deliberate: collaborator key distribution is
  an operational, not pipeline, concern.

    a bare 9, or the 0-valued equivalents — sometimes stored as integers (which
    bypass a string token list), so this checks digit content directly. Such
    values skip jitter (kept as-is) rather than fail-closing.

    CRITICAL (PHI): an all-9 digit string can ALSO be a genuine date — e.g.
    ``"9/9/99"`` = 1999-09-09 (digits "9999"). Classifying that as a sentinel
    would skip jitter and publish a real, un-shifted date — a PHI leak (a date
    more specific than year). So an all-9/all-0 value is a sentinel ONLY when it
    does not parse as a real date; a parseable date returns False here and falls
    through to jitter. The genuine sentinels (99999999, 9999-99-99, 999999, 9,

    Pre-conditions:
        * ``tmp/{STUDY}/datasets/*.jsonl`` is populated by Step 1+3.
        * ``PHI_KEY_PATH`` exists and is mode 0600 — else hard-fail.
        * A ``phi_scrub.yaml`` config is present — else the module no-ops and
          writes an empty audit (so downstream audit tooling always finds a
          fourth file).

    Parameters
    ----------
    study_name:
        Override the study name used in the audit report.  Defaults to
        ``config.STUDY_NAME``.
    run_id:
        Optional run identifier.  When provided (together with *runs_dir*),
        a ``scrub.in_progress`` token is written to
        ``runs_dir/{run_id}/scrub.in_progress`` before the scrub loop and
        deleted only on successful completion.  If the process is killed
        mid-loop the token persists, allowing the wrapper CLI to detect the
        partially-scrubbed state and refuse with exit 6.

        **SIGKILL race window:** there is a small window between the
        ``atomic_write_json`` that creates ``scrub.in_progress`` and the
        first call to ``atomic_write_jsonl`` that mutates a dataset row.  A
        SIGKILL in that window leaves the token on disk with *zero* rows
        mutated.  On the next operator retry the wrapper sees the token and
        exits with code 6.

        This is **not** a data-loss condition — no data was written.  If
        ``scrub.in_progress`` is present and the output datasets are still in
        their original pre-scrub state (zero mutations), it is safe for the
        operator to delete the token file and restart the pipeline normally.
    runs_dir:
        Directory under which per-run sidecars are stored
        (e.g. ``output/{STUDY}/runs``).  Required when *run_id* is set.
    partial_on_review:
        When ``False`` (default) the scrub is strictly fail-closed: the FIRST
        form holding a row that cannot be safely jittered/mapped
        (date/band/generalize) raises ``PHIDateUnshiftableError`` /
        ``PHIBandUnmappedError`` / ``PHIGeneralizeUnmappedError`` and aborts the
        whole study.  When ``True`` (set by the host pipeline) the scrub instead
        **quarantines only the failing ROWS** (already field-scrubbed before the
        quarantine write, kept in the AMBER no-LLM zone) and **publishes each
        form's remaining fully-scrubbed rows**, so one bad form never blocks the
        rest of the study.  The per-form quarantine counts are written to a
        ``scrub_outcome.json`` sidecar in the run dir for the wrapper CLI to
        surface as a non-blocking partial-run notice.

        **Elevated-review flag (not an abort)** — in partial mode, a form whose
        held fraction exceeds ``cfg.partial_max_quarantine_fraction`` (default 10%)
        or whose orphan count exceeds ``cfg.orphan_quarantine_threshold`` is marked
        ``elevated`` in its ``scrub_outcome.json`` entry: "published, but review
        recommended — likely a systemic data/config issue, not a small tail." It is
        deliberately NOT a hard abort: halting the whole study would deny the
        operator every *clean* form's usable data, which contradicts the partial-
        publish contract. The elevated flag preserves the systemic-failure signal
        for the operator without blocking the queryable forms. (The
        :class:`PHIPartialThresholdExceededError` class is retained for API/strict-
        mode compatibility; it is no longer raised on the partial path.)

        The security invariant is unchanged either way: a row that cannot be
        safely scrubbed is NEVER published — it is quarantined, never emitted
        to ``llm_source/``. Every PUBLISHED row is individually correct (row-level
        fail-closed scrub/date logic), so an elevated form is incomplete, never
        corrupt.

    Post-conditions:
        * Datasets JSONL rewritten in place with scrubbed values + ``_phi_scrubbed``
          marker.
        * Orphan rows (missing subject_id) land under ``tmp/{STUDY}/quarantine/``.
        * Fourth audit report emitted at :data:`config.AUDIT_SCRUB_REPORT_PATH`.
        * Sentinel ``tmp/{STUDY}/.phi_scrub_complete`` marks the run.
