"""Orchestrator: the 10-phase host publish state machine (Wave 4 B3.7).

This is the top-level entry point of the consolidated pipeline — "the plugin IS
the pipeline". It holds the per-study lock for the whole run, drives the ordered
phases, records a durable ``run_state.json``, and supports the maintainer
human-review resume loop (``--resume-held``).

Topology (the conceptual 10 runtime phases map onto the supervisory steps this
orchestrator drives; the contiguous publish phases 2-7 are executed by the
proven ``dataset-to-llm-source`` publish supervisor in one locked subprocess):

    P0  preflight   — config validation, rulebook resolve + drift, input-
                      fingerprint redundant-run check, dir pre-creation, lock
    P1c dictionary — dictionary-to-llm-source --leg extract (∥ P0 rulebook)
    P2  dedup        — dataset-deduplication (raw-file tiers; internal header reads)
    P1  headers      — header-extraction skill (shared store; column NAMES only)
    P1b SoT         — generate_lean_outputs (policy/schema → audit/SoT_construction/; only joined view → llm_source/SoT/)
    P2  publish     — dataset-to-llm-source `run` (classify → extract → scrub →
                      dedup → PHI guard gate → promote → destroy → inline verify
                      → snapshot), under the lock baton
    P8  cleanup     — cleanup_verifier over the published tree + cleanup ledgers
    P9  verify      — audit-verification skill (idempotent 16-assertion re-verify)
    P10 finalize    — record input fingerprint, finalize run_state, release lock

**Lock baton (risk #7).** The orchestrator holds the lock for the whole run and
hands a validated baton (``REPORTAL_PIPELINE_LOCK_HELD_BY_PARENT`` +
``REPORTAL_PIPELINE_LOCK_PARENT_PID = our pid``) to every skill subprocess, so
they skip re-acquisition rather than racing the same flock. Assertion 11 was
taught to accept a valid parent baton.

**Per-form state machine + crash-recovery readback (Note 16).** Beyond the
phase records, ``run_state.json`` carries a per-form state map — every form is
in exactly one of ``not_started → running → complete`` /
``held_for_review`` / ``re_running`` / ``failed_pipeline_level`` — written on
every transition the orchestrator can observe (init after P1 header store;
``running`` before
the publish leg; authoritative ``complete``/``held_for_review`` absorbed from the
run's ``phi_handling_approval.json`` after). Each form record also carries a
per-form input fingerprint (:func:`compute_per_form_fingerprint`). On restart the
preflight reads any prior ``run_state.json`` left ``in_progress`` (the per-study
lock guarantees such a run is dead, not live) and APPLIES the readback rules to
the new run's state: ``running`` forms reset to ``not_started`` (re-run);
``held_for_review`` forms remain held; prior ``complete`` forms are re-validated
by per-form fingerprint (cache-valid → kept ``complete``; inputs changed → reset
to ``not_started``). It also writes a value-free ``run_recovery.json`` and
atomically marks the crashed run recovered. This is broader than the
``cleanup.in_progress``/``scrub.in_progress`` tokens (which only catch crashes in
those sub-phases). Per-form fingerprints drive this readback classification +
observability — they do NOT drive a work-skip: the new run still re-publishes the
full surviving set, because promotion is a whole-leg atomic replace that always
re-scrubs from raw (fail-closed) (accepted deviation D4, CLAUDE.md §4).

Value-free: ``run_state.json`` carries phase names, statuses, exit codes, form
NAMES, per-form states, fingerprints (hashes), and counts — never a row value.
